# image-colorizer

## Overview
image colorizer is a desktop app written in java to colorize grey scale images using **Floodfill Algorithm** ,this project was built to explore image-proccesing concepts and learn how computers deal with image pixels and color theory with no external libararies.
## Flood Fill Algorithm:
is a flooding algorithm that determines and alters the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array with some matching attribute. It is used in the "bucket" fill tool of paint programs to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as Go and Minesweeper for determining which pieces are cleared. A variant called boundary fill uses the same algorithms but is defined as the area connected to a given node that does not have a particular attribute.<br>
here is a visual explanation of the algorithm<br>

## what the project contains:
1- Jave implementation of the Flood Fill algorithm<br>
2- GUI for the colorizer app <br>
3- Detailed report about how the project implemented (in Arabic)
## how to use the project:
this project was written in java and Neatbeans IDE so you can use it directly with neatbeans or you can copy its classes to any IDE that Support JAVA(eclipse,VScode,IntelliJ...etc)<br>
examples folder contains some grey scale images so i encourage you to try out the app using the examples images or a grey image of yours<br>
1- select a grey scale image (or black and white)<br>
2- select a color using the color wheel<br>
3- draw some lines <br>
4- press process button to run the flood fill algorithm <br>
5- undo any step <br>
here is an example using image colorize app: <br><br>
